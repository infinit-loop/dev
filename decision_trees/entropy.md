Here's how we calculate entropy:

Count the Balls: First, you count how many red balls and blue balls there are.

Calculate the Probability: Next, you figure out the chance of picking a red ball and the chance of picking a blue ball. If there are 8 red balls and 6 blue balls, the chance of picking a red ball is (8/14) (because there are 8 red balls out of 14 total balls), and the chance of picking a blue ball is (6/14).

Plug into the Formula: Finally, you plug those probabilities into the entropy formula:

Entropy = - (p<sub>red</sub> ⋅ log₂(p<sub>red</sub>) + p<sub>blue</sub> ⋅ log₂(p<sub>blue</sub>))

Here, p<sub>red</sub> and p<sub>blue</sub> are the probabilities we calculated earlier.

Calculate: You do the math and get a number. If you've got a mix of red and blue balls, the entropy will be somewhere between 0 (if they're all the same color) and 1 (if they're perfectly mixed).

So, in simple terms, entropy is like a measure of how mixed up or uncertain things are, and the formula helps us put a number on that uncertainty based on the probabilities of different outcomes.
