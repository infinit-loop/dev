In information theory, "information" refers to the reduction in uncertainty or the amount of surprise gained when an event occurs. It's a measure of how much something helps you learn or make predictions.

When we talk about "information gain" in decision trees, we're essentially referring to the amount of information about the target variable (the thing we're trying to predict) that is gained by splitting the dataset based on a particular feature (characteristic).

Here's why it's called "information gain":

Gain: It's called "gain" because we're gaining knowledge or reducing uncertainty about the target variable when we split the dataset based on a feature. The goal is to maximize this gain, meaning we want to split the data in a way that provides the most useful information for making predictions.

Information: Each feature has a certain amount of information associated with it. This information is measured in terms of how well the feature helps us predict the target variable. The more information a feature provides about the target variable, the higher its information gain.

So, "information gain" essentially means the amount of useful information we gain about the target variable by splitting the dataset based on a particular feature. It helps us understand which features are the most informative and should be used as the basis for splitting the data in a decision tree.
